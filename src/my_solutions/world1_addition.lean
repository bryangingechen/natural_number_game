import mynat.definition -- Imports the natural numbers.
---
/- Here's what you get from the import:

1. The following data:
  * a type called `mynat`
  * a term `0 : mynat`, interpreted as the number zero.
  * a function `succ : mynat → mynat`, with `succ n` interpreted as "the number after n".
  * Usual numerical notation 0,1,2,3,4,5 etc.

2. The following axioms:
  * `zero_ne_succ : ∀ (a : mynat), zero ≠ succ(a)`, the statement that zero isn't a successor.
    - this ensures that there is more than one natural number.
  * `succ_inj : ∀ {a b : mynat}, succ(a) = succ(b) → a = b`, the statement that
     `if succ(a) = succ(b) then a = b`.
    - this ensures that there are infinitely many natural numbers.

3. The principle of mathematical induction.

  * In practice this means that if you have `n : mynat` then you can use the tactic `induction n`.

4. A few useful extra things:

  * The theorem `one_eq_succ_zero : 1 = succ 0`
  * The theorem `ne_iff_implies_false : a ≠ b ↔ (a = b) → false`

import mynat.add -- definition of addition
---
/- Here's what you get from the import:

1) The following data:
  * a function called mynat.add, and notation a + b for this function

2) The following axioms:

  * `add_zero : ∀ a : mynat, a + 0 = a`
  * `add_succ : ∀ a b : mynat, a + succ(b) = succ(a + b)`

These axiom between them tell you how to work out a + x for every x; use induction on x to
reduce to the case either `x = 0` or `x = succ b`, and then use `add_zero` or `add_succ` appropriately.

/-Summary:

Naturals:
1. 0 and succ are constants
2. succ_inj and zero_ne_succ are axioms
3. Induction works.

Addition:
1. add_zero and add_succ are the axioms
2. notation is a + b

Instructions: First carefully explain definition of `nat` and `add`. Then
guide them through the first level.

"We're going to prove this by induction on n, which is a natural
thing to do because we defined addition by recursion on n (you
prove things by induction and define them by recursion).

For the base case, we are going to use the axiom that `a + 0 = 0`.
refl closes a goal of the form `x = x`. how to use add_succ here?

etc.

Full solution to zero_add:

```
  induction n with d hd,
    rw add_zero,
    refl,
  rw add_succ,
  rw hd,
  refl,
```
